# Ban Appeals

> ![WARNING]
> We are not responsible for handling ban appeals for TGP and other GBan Handlers.
> We sometimes handle Karma ban appeals too...


### 112-SB (Global Banlist)

You can use [Skidisher Skidtru](https://github.com/ocbwoy3/SkidisherSkidtru) or any other Discord bot (which has global ban lookups) to look yourself up on the 112 banlist.
As an alternative method, you can search your Roblox User ID on the banland.json file. You can learn about the banland [here](/docs/112/bans).

### Karma

You can use Skidisher Skidtru, as mentioned earlier.

The banland URLs is: https://karma.ocbwoy3.dev/bans

## The appeal message

:::warning Be Polite

Having derogatory language in your appeal message will give you a worser punishment.

:::

Admitting to guilt and your actions in most cases will increase the chance of your appeal being accepted!

Your appeal message must explain why you should be unbanned. You are allowed to provide the necessary proof for an unban. Your reason for an appeal shoul have at least 50 words, but we recommend at least 100-150.

Your message must also contain:

1. Your Discord User ID (if you have a Discord account)
2. Your Roblox Username and User ID

## Appealing your ban

:::warning Alternative methods

If sending a DM to me failed (most likely because my DMs are off, or you are blocked), you can always write an email or message me on Bluesky!

### Via E-mail

:::warning Temporary E-Mail Addresses

Do not use a temporary email, as we will not be able to reach out to you regarding your appeal.
Make sure we, and you can receive the appeal email!

If you pay for iCloud+, I recommend "Hide My Email".

You should check Your Junk folder for any e-mails regarding your appeal.

:::

Adress your email to `ocbwoy3@ocbwoy3.dev` with the title `"112 Ban Appeal - USERNAME"`, with `USERNAME` being Your Roblox Username.

A ban appeal email would look like this:

Discord User ID: 486147449703104523
