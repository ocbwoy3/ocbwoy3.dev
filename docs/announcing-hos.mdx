### 🚨 Introducing the Hall of Skids 🚨

Welcome to the **Hall of Skids**, a brand-new update to ocbwoy3.dev built after various iterations of the "Hall of Shame."
This is where we publicly expose and shame banned users who have proven themselves to be a menace to the community.
Whether you're a **script kiddie (skid), a scammer, a sexual predator, or just an overall disgrace to society**,
this is where your reputation meets its digital downfall.

If you're here, it means you've messed up big time. Your actions have caught up to you, and now the entire community gets to witness your failure.

### ❌ How to Earn Your Spot in the Hall of Skids ❌

Getting inducted into the **Hall of Skids** is no small feat. Only the most notorious and deserving individuals make it onto this **public wall of shame**.
To secure your spot, you must either match one of these:

<br/>
<ul className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
	<li>-  Get banned from the **112 ban manager**, proving you are unfit for the community.</li>
	<li>-  Be universally despised by the **Roblox SB (Script Builder) community**, showing that your behavior is intolerable.</li>
	<li>-  Engage in skid-tier activity.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

If you find yourself on this list, **too bad!** Actions have consequences, and this is where yours are permanently displayed. However, you **can** appeal if you believe you've been wrongfully placed here—but good luck with that. 😈

### 🔥 Current Inductees 🔥

### 🛡️ Why the Hall of Skids Exists

You might be wondering: *why publicly shame these people?*

The answer is simple: **accountability.** 

Too many people get away with being skids, scammers, or otherwise toxic members of the community.
The **Hall of Skids** serves as a deterrent—if you don’t want to end up here, don’t act like a skid.
The community deserves a space free of those who bring nothing but problems, and this initiative ensures that everyone knows exactly who to avoid.
